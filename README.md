# Project Setup Guide

## Setting Up the Project on a Fresh Linux Machine

Follow these steps to get your Django project up and running on a freshly installed Linux machine.

### 1. Install Python and pip

Make sure Python 3 and pip (Python's package installer) are installed.

#### Check if Python is installed:

```bash
python3 --version
If Python is not installed, run:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Creating a virtual environment isolates project dependencies and ensures compatibility.

Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
Your terminal prompt should now show (myenv) indicating the environment is active.

3. Install Project Dependencies
If you're using a requirements.txt file, install all dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, if you want to install Django manually:

bash
Copy code
pip install django
If you're using a specific database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), you may need to install additional dependencies (see next steps).

4. Install Database Dependencies (if needed)
If you're using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or another database, you'll need the appropriate adapter.

For PostgreSQL:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install libpq-dev
pip install psycopg2
For MySQL:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev
pip install mysqlclient
For SQLite (default):
No extra installation is required for SQLite since itâ€™s bundled with Python. However, if you need the SQLite libraries:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
5. Set Up the Database
For PostgreSQL:
Create a new database:

bash
Copy code
sudo -u postgres createdb mydatabase
For MySQL:
Create a new database:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
If you are using SQLite, no setup is required as it is file-based.

6. Apply Database Migrations
Run migrations to set up your database schema:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
7. Create a Superuser (Optional)
To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set up the username, email, and password.

8. Run the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Your project will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
